# Background and Objectives: 


Colorectal cancer, often known as colon cancer or rectal cancer, is a kind of cancer that starts in the intestines. Histopathological image analysis is a branch of medicine that involves the microscopic examination and interpretation of tissue samples in order to understand the structural and cellular alterations associated with illnesses. Pathologists have traditionally depended on physical examination of stained tissue slides under a microscope to diagnose illnesses. Histopathological image analysis, however, has advanced with the advent of digital pathology to include computer-based approaches for extracting relevant information from digitized images of tissue specimens. Material and Methods: In this study, we conducted histopathological image analysis for the classification of colon cancer from benign to malignant using a dataset comprising histopathological images of colon tissues. The principal aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of two distinct feature extraction techniques: morphological feature extraction and Haralick features. This assessment was conducted within the framework of training a deep learning model using transfer learning, specifically employing the ResNet-18 architecture. The investigation delved into the comparative performance of these feature extraction methods in enhancing the capabilities of the neural network model for various applications and tasks. Results: The Haralick Features-based Convolutional Neural Network displayed remarkable performance, achieving 98.50% accuracy in classifying colorectal cancer histopathological images, while the Morphological Features-trained CNN demonstrated robust classification with an accuracy of 97.88% on the test set.
